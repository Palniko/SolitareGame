Solitaire is a classic single-player card game that involves sorting cards in a specific order. The most well-known version is Klondike Solitaire. The goal of the game is to move all cards to four foundation piles, sorted by suit and in ascending order from Ace to King.

The game is played with a standard 52-card deck. At the start, cards are arranged in seven tableau columns. The first column has one card, the second has two, and so on up to the seventh column with seven cards. Only the top card in each column is face up; the rest are face down. The remaining cards form the draw pile.

Players can move cards between tableau columns in descending order and alternating colors (e.g., a red 6 on a black 7). Aces can be moved to the foundation piles, and once started, only the next higher card of the same suit can be placed on top (e.g., 2 of hearts on Ace of hearts).

Cards from the draw pile can be used to help organize the tableau or fill foundation piles. The game is won when all four suits are fully assembled in the foundation piles.

Solitaire is known for its relaxing pace and the challenge of strategic thinking. It is often included with computer operating systems and remains a popular way to pass the time.
